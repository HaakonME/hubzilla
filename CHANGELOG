	Implement singleton delivery (emulate nomadic identity to singleton networks and services)
	Fix empty album name in photo activities when photo is stored in top level folder.
	Allow engineering units to be used in service class data size restrictions (400M, 1G, etc.)

			upgrade all inbound paths with the most recent protocol changes (several of these)
			convert 'diaspora_meta' (Diaspora Comment Virus) to iconfig and eradicate from sites with Diaspora disabled
			implement social relay and allow following tags
			upgrade statistics.json to NodeInfo. Currently hubzilla sites are tagged as 'redmatrix' because the NodeInfo schema lacks extensibility and project names are used to designate protocol compatibility rather than protocol names.
		Std-embeds
			New addon to allow a handful of corporate providers to run unfiltered embed code (youtube, vimeo, soundcloud) 
		Various:
			upgrade font-awesome icons and adapt a few addons to Objects and the new hook interface and new controller interface
