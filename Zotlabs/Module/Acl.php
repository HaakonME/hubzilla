/*
 * ACL selector json backend 
 * This module provides JSON lists of connections and local/remote channels
 * (xchans) to populate various tools such as the ACL (AccessControlList) popup
 * and various auto-complete functions (such as email recipients, search, and 
 * mention targets.
 * There are two primary output structural formats. One for the ACL widget and
 * the other for auto-completion.
 * Many of the  behaviour variations are triggered on the use of single character keys
 * however this functionality has grown in an ad-hoc manner and has gotten quite messy over time.
